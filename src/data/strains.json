[OG Kush](/strains/og-kush) contributed strength, density, and body effects, while Durban Poison added cerebral lift and sweetness. This combination produced a strain that was both mentally engaging and physically relaxing.\n\nUnlike earlier strains that spread quietly, GSC circulated through a mix of underground cultivation and early legal markets, allowing its characteristics to be preserved and rapidly refined into multiple phenotypes."
