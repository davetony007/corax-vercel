The \"Menu\" isn't Food\nWhen you walk in, ask for the \"Menu\". This is the weed list. Don't sit down first; buy your product at the counter, *then* find a table.\n\n### 3. Cash is Still King (Sometimes)\nWhile many spots now take card, legendary old-school shops often remain **Cash Only**. Always carry €50 in cash just in case.\n\n### 4. Don't Buy 5 Grams Immediately\nThe legal limit is 5g per person per day. Don't max it out at the first shop! Buy 1g, try it, and explore elsewhere. Variety is the spice of life."

If you roll with tobacco, keep it discreet or sit in a designated smoking room (if they have one).\n\n### 6. Hats & Sunglasses Off\nIt's a security thing. Take off your hat and sunglasses when entering. It shows respect and stops the bouncer from worrying.\n\n### 7. Don't Camp Without Buying\nCoffeeshops are businesses. If you occupy a table for 2 hours, buy drinks and snacks. Don't bring outside food."

For real top-shelf, check our Best Hash list.\n\n### 9. The Edible Warning\nDutch edibles are often stronger than you expect. Start with **half** a cake. Wait 90 minutes. Do NOT eat more because \"you don't feel it yet.\"\n\n### 10. Alcohol + Weed = Spinning\nKeep them separate. Most coffeeshops don't serve alcohol, and bars don't let you smoke weed inside. Mixing them is the #1 reason tourists faint (\"whitey\")."
