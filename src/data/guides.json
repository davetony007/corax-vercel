The \"Menu\" isn't Food\nWhen you walk in, ask for the \"Menu\". This is the weed list. Don't sit down first; buy your product at the counter, *then* find a table.\n\n### 3. Cash is Still King (Sometimes)\nWhile many spots now take card, legendary old-school shops often remain **Cash Only**. Always carry €50 in cash just in case.\n\n### 4. Don't Buy 5 Grams Immediately\nThe legal limit is 5g per person per day. Don't max it out at the first shop! Buy 1g, try it, and explore elsewhere. Variety is the spice of life."

Take off your hat and sunglasses when entering. It shows respect and stops the bouncer from worrying.\n\n### 7. Don't Camp Without Buying\nCoffeeshops are businesses.

Do NOT eat more because \"you don't feel it yet.\"\n\n### 10. Alcohol + Weed = Spinning\nKeep them separate. Most coffeeshops don't serve alcohol, and bars don't let you smoke weed inside.

    "intro": "Building on the consistency of the [2000s medical era](/guides/the-2000s-medical-cannabis-commercial-giants), by the 2010s cannabis breeding entered a new phase — one driven as much by **flavour, branding, and visual appeal** as by potency. Legal markets expanded, competition intensified, and consumers began choosing strains the same way they choose food: by name, taste, and reputation.\n\nThis era didn’t abandon genetics — it *weaponised* them. Breeders stacked elite lineages to create strains that tasted like desserts, photographed beautifully, and delivered reliably strong effects. The result was the rise of the Cookies family, candy strains, and modern hype genetics.",
